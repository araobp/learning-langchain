# Learning LangChain

## Background and Motivation

In the past half year, I have learned NLP with spaCy and SQLite. I am using the NLP skill in my work these days.

My company is marketing LLM ["NEC cotomi"](https://www.nec.com/en/press/202404/global_20240424_01.html), so I learn LLM with my NLP skill in this project as a marketer.

## Project Goal

I am a fan of SQLite, so I study in this project how I can use SQLite as a part of RAG.

## OpenAI API

## VectorDB

- [Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/)
- [sqlite-vec](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec)

## GraphDB

I have already developed GraphDB with SQLite and networks on my own at work.
